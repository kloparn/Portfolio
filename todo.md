# TODO LIST

- fix the issue with the burger menu, when it's closed it moved the information to the right instead of keeping it in the middle

* ways to reproduce
  1. open the site, if you haven't been on it before it will be there by default.
  2. if not, then go to phone mode, then close the burger menu.
  3. go back to destop view.
  4. results

- Create a dropdown menu instead of a burger menu that slides in from the right. (much fancier?)
