# TODO LIST

- fix the issue with the burger menu, when it's closed it moved the information to the right instead of keeping it in the middle

* ways to reproduce
  1. open the site, if you haven't been on it before it will be there by default.
  2. if not, then go to phone mode, then close the burger menu.
  3. go back to destop view.
  4. results

## Progress

It is now correctly displayed the first time you open the site, but will not be dynamicly updated, so if you go to burger menu mode,
then close the menu and go back it's moved to the right.
