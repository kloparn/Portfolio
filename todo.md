# TODO LIST

- add information to the project page, (do a api call to the back-end)
- make sure everything is flexable when rescaling the window (do this with every update of the content)

## issues

- When having the activeClassName="selectedLink" on the (home) button it is always shown to be pressed even on other tabs

## possible improvement changes

- Make the pictures go under the nav bar a little bit.
- Make the text with the background pictures easier to read?
