# TODO LIST

- add information to the project page, (do a api call to the back-end)
- Re-create the cards from scratch so they look better (use a referense for a card instead of raw html? https://tailwindcss.com/components/cards/)
- make sure everything is flexable when rescaling the window (do this with every update of the content)
